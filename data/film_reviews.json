This one has the same elements, but told in a way that do not evoke any feelings towards the characters. The story behind Mysterio makes no sense this Peter Parker feels just like a whiny kid. Other than that, I enjoyed a lot the character of Mysterio in general, and the way it was portrayed. It is one of my favorite Spiderman villains and the realism in his technology was very creative and enjoyable. However, that alone can't make for a good movie.","score":"65","review_date":"2020-05-30"},"film":{"id":429617,"imdb_id":"tt6320628","title":"Spider-Man: Far from Home","original_title":"Spider-Man: Far from Home","release_date":"2019-06-28","poster_url":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/4q2NNj4S5dG2RLF9CpXsej7yXl.jpg","directors":[{"id":1293994,"job":"Director","name":"Jon Watts","profile_path":"/fkXChMX6CUXY1yOxBehAzvaTCl7.jpg"}],"writers":[{"department":"Writing","id":7624,"job":"Comic Book","name":"Stan Lee","profile_path":"/nGjBAc25C3LT23NqeOfY1pCcax8.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","id":7625,"job":"Comic Book","name":"Steve Ditko","profile_path":"/dfdSdCN8Zb9MD5qSkpMseze4n8H.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","id":1246890,"job":"Writer","name":"Chris McKenna","profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","id":1350918,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Erik Sommers","profile_path":"/jTUmHM0C8zykhVla56m8opeARm2.jpg"}],"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}]}},{"id":1597309070873,"content":{"text":"What a fucking masterpiece. Holy shit. This will go down as one of the most disturbing films I've ever seen. The cruelty as a main topic is amazingly portrayed, and the prolongation of it for so long is what makes this movie so great. It is constant torture, over and over again, for everyone. The acting and directing are equally wonderful. And the attention to details is on a whole new level on this one. The way the 4th wall is broken as well.","score":"95","review_date":"2020-05-30"},"film":{"id":10234,"imdb_id":"tt0119167","title":"Funny Games","original_title":"Funny Games","release_date":"1997-05-14","poster_url":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/gN67MODa2ZtDcIoXTdZ5SHzxAkt.jpg","directors":[{"id":6011,"job":"Director","name":"Michael Haneke","profile_path":"/6HuUIn0bg9h6kfE5gJnX7tWTXdv.jpg"}],"writers":[{"department":"Writing","id":6011,"job":"Screenplay","name":"Michael Haneke","profile_path":"/6HuUIn0bg9h6kfE5gJnX7tWTXdv.jpg"}],"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}]}},{"id":1597309103767,"content":{"text":"The comedy in this movie is so great and makes it deserving of all the attention it gets. However, I believe it doesn't work as a film. It has plenty of elements that don't really add up to a conclusion. One may argue that it is all because of The Dude's \"POV\" or simply because that's what the movie is trying to say, but I think some elements feel more like a mistake than a meaningful element. All in all the comedy and the cinematography are very enjoyable.","score":"70","review_date":"2020-05-26"},"film":{"id":115,"imdb_id":"tt0118715","title":"The Big Lebowski","original_title":"The Big Lebowski","release_date":"1998-03-06","poster_url":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/48auuGpzl9KSZixAKwj8yKBNIv4.jpg","directors":[{"id":1223,"job":"Director","name":"Joel Coen","profile_path":"/rgVaJNkZCgMarUcZuUAsVfXMWk3.jpg"}],"writers":[{"department":"Writing","id":1223,"job":"Writer","name":"Joel Coen","profile_path":"/rgVaJNkZCgMarUcZuUAsVfXMWk3.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","id":1224,"job":"Writer","name":"Ethan Coen","profile_path":"/3sRAtssJcrapmG029xfu1uJa7QR.jpg"}],"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}]}},{"id":1597309144262,"content":{"text":"Great animation and concept. The music connects very well with the whole theme of the movie as well. In general, the movie is good. It has a very mysterious and dynamic start that sets up a theme, mood and questions in the best way it possibly could. However, as the movie progresses, many of the questions remain unanswered. Most of the story shifts focus to the why's of the evil characters instead of the actual arcs of the main characters. Most of the story becomes dull after the first half, and some of the characters start acting in different ways than they used to. Oddly enough, this is a thing that Christopher Nolan worked really hard to get right on Inception, the movie heavily based on this one.

The characters were very well portrayed, written and acted. There was something very identifying about each of them, even if it's not very clear at the start of the movie. The idea behind the movie is good, but it's not clear and that's why it feels slow at the start. The idea being \"the days before classes start\". Story wise, it tried to follow on Boyhood's footsteps with an very subtle not so clear storytelling, but I think the conflict wasn't so clear. About the main character, I don't think he was the right actor for the job... or maybe the character wasn't just right. I think that the main character didn't have a big conflict to start with, he was just living his baseball dream and getting chicks until the middle of the movie.","score":"70","review_date":"2020-06-12"},"film":{"id":295699,"imdb_id":"tt2937696","title":"Everybody Wants Some!!","original_title":"Everybody Wants Some!!","release_date":"2016-03-30","poster_url":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/vAIFZ8bw0spSvcIYgfuX99B3H2w.jpg","directors":[{"id":564,"job":"Director","name":"Richard Linklater","profile_path":"/wNijRefhQCp0BkNqM5qhhdazDgx.jpg"}],"writers":[{"department":"Writing","id":564,"job":"Writer","name":"Richard Linklater","profile_path":"/wNijRefhQCp0BkNqM5qhhdazDgx.jpg"}],"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}]}},{"id":1597309264205,"content":{"text":"What the fuck. I liked the image driven storytelling. The care for detail made this movie very enjoyable. I'm not sure what the movie really is about, but I think I have a slight idea. The story is kinda clear, but the motivation and theme behind it are not within my reach. So it was interpreted by women... holy shit. What the fuck. I think it had slow moments where nothing of importance was happening, but it didn't really feel like a big problem.

In my opinion, it is what makes the movie great. However, it has a couple of flaws that can't go undetected. Many moments seem unnecessary and I'm fairly certain that this could have easily been a short film. It would have had a greater impact on the narrative and the whole idea would still be conveyed. The character of Margus is very odd for me, he seems very unreal and his decisions don't make sense very often. He is very agreeable and that makes him boring. I also notice a touch of comedy in his character, but I'm not sure it fits the theme and the character itself.

It was confusing and slow at first for me, but as the film progressed, it became very obvious what the conflict was about. It's very interesting how this movie still has a lot of influence from theater, especially at the start. Some of the shots at the start (the closeups) seem a little off, maybe too personal with the audience. The cuts are sometimes very rough and unexpected, but that may have just been the style at the time. The photography is beyond incredible in this movie, one of the highlights, especially interior shots. It has beautiful and heartwarming ending that makes the movie just perfect for those of us who love a good family drama.","score":"98","review_date":"2020-08-18"},"film":{"id":18148,"imdb_id":"tt0046438","title":"Tokyo Story","original_title":"東京物語","release_date":"1953-11-03","poster_url":"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w200/g2YbTYKpY7N2yDSk7BfXZ18I5QV.jpg","directors":[{"id":95501,"job":"Director","name":"Yasujirō Ozu","profile_path":"/s0KBnwAxr6Aujbi6cA3inDqH8Fe.jpg"}],"writers":[{"department":"Writing","id":95501,"job":"Writer","name":"Yasujirō Ozu","profile_path":"/s0KBnwAxr6Aujbi6cA3inDqH8Fe.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","id":131010,"job":"Writer","name":"Kōgo Noda","profile_path":"/gK4hSppQWVZab0Y1LL4pg7UcSsf.jpg"}],"countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}]}},{"id":1598450075602,"content":{"text":"I found myself asking too many times \"Will Jim Jarmusch do it?\" I was often questioning whether the story or characters would do certain things.

The movie had some literary touches to it; in a sense I felt like I was reading a book. I can't explain why, it probably has to do with the way objects and characters are set.

I think it lost all the tension it created, maybe its because the main focus of the story should have always been the kid and then it switched to the politics of the movie.
